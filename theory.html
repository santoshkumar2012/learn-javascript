/** JAVASCRIPT **/

1. What is prototype ? 
Ans. A prototype is an existing inbuilt functionality in JavaScript. Whenever we create a JavaScript function.

<code>
    function Person(name, age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }
    
    // Adding a method to the prototype
    Person.prototype.sayHello = function() {
        return `Hello, my name is ${this.name}`;
    };
    
    const person1 = new Person("Santosh", 30);
    console.log(person1.sayHello()); // Output: Hello, my name is Santosh    
</code>
2. Closure ?
Ans. A closure in JavaScript is a function that has access to variables in its parent scope. 
Inner function retain access to the variable.
<code>
    function outerFunction() {
        let count = 0;  // count is in the lexical scope of innerFunction
    
        function innerFunction() {
            count++;  // innerFunction remembers 'count'
            console.log(count);
        }
    
        return innerFunction;  // Returns the inner function
    }
    
    const counter = outerFunction();  // outerFunction executes and returns innerFunction
    counter(); // Output: 1
    counter(); // Output: 2
    counter(); // Output: 3    
</code>

5. Hoisting is a default behavior in JavaScript where variable and function declarations are moved to the top.

3. ES6 (also known as ECMAScript 2015) introduced several new features and improvements to JavaScript.

var is function-scoped
let is block-scoped : It is only accessible within the block {}

* Let and Const : It is accessible throughout the function
* Arrow Functions : const add = (a, b) => a + b;

* Rest Operator - Rest Operator 'collects' multiple elements into an array.
<code> 
function sum(...numbers) { return numbers.reduce((total, num) => total + num, 0); }
console.log(sum(10, 20, 30, 40));
</code>
* Spread Operator - Spread operator is used to spread the content of an array.
<code>
    const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
    const arr2 = [...arr1, 4, 5, 6];
    console.log(arr2);
</code>
* Classes
* Promises
* Map and Set ( Map Stores key-value pairs, Set is a collection of unique values. )
<code>
let myArray = [1,2,3]
let obj = new set(myArray);
console.log(obj)
--------------------
let myMap=new Map();
myMap.set('name', 'Santosh');
console.log(myMap);
</code>

4. Destructuring 
Ans. Destructuring in JavaScript is a shorthand syntax for extracting values from arrays or properties from objects and assigning them to variables. 
* Array Destructuring
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
const [a, b] = arr;
console.log(a); // 1
console.log(b); // 2

5. Promise
A promise is an object that my produce a single value some time in  the futrue. 

6. Callback Function 
Ans - A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function.

7. Data Structural 
JavaScript provides various data structures to handle different use cases.
Array, Object, Map, Set, Data Types

8. Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top.
<code>
    getName();
    var = 5
    function getName(){
        console.log("santosh")
    }
</code>

push() - Add one or more element to the end of the an array. array.push("Testing")
pop() - Remove the last elements. array.pop()
shift() - Remove the first element of the array.
unshift() - Add new element to the begining of an array.
slice() - Extracts a portian of an array without modifying the orginal.
splice() - Adds, remove or replace element in an array. - array.splice (2,0, 30)
map() - Create a new array by applying a function to every elements. const santk = pragya.map((x) => x*2)

=> Box Model - box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: content, padding, borders and margins.

Undefined that has been declared but not yet assigned a value.

Null is an assignment value meaning that a varriable has been declared and given the value of null.

ForEach method is used to iterate over arrays and execute a provided function once for each element.
* ForEach is faster because it doesn’t create a new array.
* map is slightly slower because it returns a new array.


Currying
Transforming a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of functions.

Debouncing & Throttling
Debouncing limits the execution of a function until after a certain delay.

Throttling ensures a function runs at most once in a specified interval.

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];

const doubled = numbers.map(num => num * 2);
console.log(doubled); // [2, 4, 6, 8]

const evens = numbers.filter(num => num % 2 === 0);
console.log(evens); // [2, 4]

const sum = numbers.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0);
console.log(sum); // 10

ANGULAR 17 New Features
----------------------------------------------------------------------

angular.dev
-Standalone by default - No Need for NgModules – Simplifies component structure., Faster Bootstrap, Better Lazy Loading
-Improved SSR Support
-Signals are Stable now
-Cotrol Flow
*ngIf - @if
*ngFor - @for
*ngSwitch - @switch

AngularJS is a JavaScript framework developed by Google for building dynamic single-page applications (SPAs). 
It extends HTML with additional attributes and binds data to the UI dynamically.

the core type of the RxJS library

AOT - Ahead of time compilation at build time application runs. 
JIT - Just in time

Observable - Angular, an observable is a data stream that can change over time.  It's a core part of reactive programming.

1. How to use multiple API in angular ?
Angular, We can use multiple APIs in different ways.
Using forkJoin (Parallel API Calls - Best for Independent APIs)

<script>
    forkJoin([
      this.http.get('https://api.example.com/users'),
      this.http.get('https://api.example.com/posts')
    ]).subscribe(([users, posts]) => {
      console.log('Users:', users);
      console.log('Posts:', posts);
    });
</script>

2. State Management in Angular
State management in Angular is the process of handling application data efficiently across components, services, and routes. 
Local State
Component State 
Service State (App-Level State)

SSR - server-side rendering (SSR) is a process that involves rendering pages on the server, resulting in initial HTML content which contains initial page state. 

4. Component there are the basic building block of and angular application contract html views.

5. Modules -  Modules is a container group related component directives, pipes and services @ngModule

6. Decorator - Decorator is a function that add metadata to a class.
@component, @directives, @ngModule

7. @ViewChild and @ViewChildren are decorators used to access child components,
   @ViewChild - It is used to get a single child component, directive.
   @viewChildren - It is used to get multiple child components, directives.

7. directives
Diretives is class that modifies the behaviour appearance of the elements
Structural directives
attributes directives
custom directives

8. Constructor - Constructor is a function that initialization an application component servcies and directives.

8. Services Angular services is a resuable typescript class that provides data. Resuable 
<code></code>

9. @injectable
@injectale is a decorator in angular that makes a class as a services.

11. Dependancy injectable is used to inject services into components/classes. It makes code reusable testable and maintainable.

12. Store is a centralized state management solution that holds the application’s state  
and provides mechanisms to update and access the state efficiently.


10. In Angular 17, authentication involves:

Login Page – User enters credentials.
Auth Service – Handles authentication & token storage. ( dedicated service within your application that handles all user authentication logic, including login, logout )
Dashboard Component – Accessible only after login.
Auth Guard – Protects routes from unauthorized access. ( Auth Guard is a mechanism that controls access to routes based on user authentication. )

Lazy loading ondemand load 

1. Git pull automatically merges the fetched changes into the current branch, git fetch does no 
2. Git Fetch a primary command used to download contents from a remote repository.
3. Git stash git stash command takes your uncommitted changes and saves later use. 

Angular project
Login page Validation Issues
In one of my Angular projects, the login page validation was not working correctly. Even when users entered invalid credentials, the error messages were not displaying properly.

Solution 
I checked the form setup and realized i had forgotten to use Angular's FormGroup and FormControl properly.
I updated the form using ReactiveForms Module and added Validation for required fields and incorrect credentials.
Used this.loginForm.controls ["email"].errors to correctly display validation messages.

Learend
Always check if ReactiveFormsModule is imported in the module.

<script> 
    
user_details = [
  {
    name: "achyut kadam",
    age: 28
  },
  {
    name: "Santosh Kumar",
    age: 39
  },
  {
    name: "gorakh sanas",
    age: 33
  }
]

length = user_details.length

for(let i=0; i< length; i++){
  console.log('user--->', user_details[i]);
}

for(let user of user_details){
  console.log('user--->', user);
}

</script>

<div *ngIf="isLoggedIn; else showLogin">
  <p>Welcome, User!</p>
</div>

<form [formGroup]="lead_form" (ngSubmit)="saveLead()">
  <input type="text" class="form-control" placeholder="Name" formControlName="name">
  <div class="error-message" *ngIf="lead_form.get('name')?.touched && lead_form.get('name')?.hasError('required')">
  Name is required. </div>
  </form>

  const routes: Routes = [
  { path: '', component: HomeComponent },
  ];

  // services 
  previousButton(){
    if(sessionStorage.getItem('role') == "client"){
      return false
    }
    return true
  }

  //api call
  ngOnInit() {
    this._http.get('users/user/details/'+this.user_id).subscribe((resposne: any) => {
      this.user = resposne.user
      console.log(resposne);
    })
  }
