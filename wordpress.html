<div>
<h2 class="mt-5"> <strong> Intro for wordpress </strong> </h2>
<p> I completed my MCA in 2016 and have around 5 years of experience as a WordPress developer. </p>
<p> I started my career with Smac Digital, an IT service–based company in Jaipur, where I worked remotely as a frontend developer. Since the company had many WordPress projects, I got the opportunity to work on WordPress. I developed multiple projects there, including Shreerakhi and Ashoka Holidays, and gained strong hands-on experience over 3 years. </p>
<p> After that, I joined ACL Digital Pvt. Ltd. as a WordPress Developer. My main responsibility was to take designs from Figma, convert them into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with pixel-perfect responsiveness, and then develop them into WordPress websites using Elementor theme. Along with WordPress, I also worked on Shopify theme customization, following the same process of converting Figma designs into responsive themes. </p>
<p> Overall, I have good experience in WordPress development, theme customization, responsive design, and Shopify customization. </p>
</div>


<hr>

<h2> <strong> Intro </strong> </h2>
<p> My name is Santosh Kumar, and I have over 8 years of experience as a web designer.  I started my career at Redcube Digital Pvt. Ltd. as a Web Designer. I specialize in creating clean, user-friendly, and CRO-based (Conversion Rate Optimization) designs that are both visually appealing and performance-driven. </p>
<p> I always start by understanding the client’s requirements, create the design accordingly, and once it's approved, I also handle the front-end coding part. I have hands-on coding knowledge and convert the approved designs into responsive HTML using CSS. </p>
<p> Over the years, I've worked on a wide variety of projects, including landing pages, eCommerce sites, dashboards, and responsive websites. I enjoy collaborating with developers, product teams, and marketers to make sure the final product meets both business and user goals." </p>
===========================
<p> In development, I have worked on several projects using WordPress and Shopify. Based on the design requirements, I handled UI implementation and ensured pixel-perfect results in both platforms. I managed the entire workflow — starting from creating the design, converting it into HTML/CSS using Bootstrap, making it fully responsive, and finally integrating it into WordPress or Shopify themes." </p>
<h2> <strong> Why you left the previouse company. </strong></h2>
<p> My previous job was a 3-year contractual position. Once the contract period ended, my tenure with the company concluded, which is why I left the role. </p>
<p class="p-0 m-0"> <strong> Reason stay with 6 month </strong></p>
<p> I also used this time to explore remote work opportunities and align with a role that truly fits my long-term goals. </p>

<hr>

<h2> <strong> Why you want to join less salary ? </strong></h2>
<p> In my previous company, my salary was higher, but my daily expenses such as travel and food were also significantly more. By working from home, I can save on those daily costs, which is why I am comfortable accepting a salary that is slightly lower than my previous one.</p>

</div>

<hr>
<hr>


<div id="childtheme">
<h2> How to create child Theme </h2>
<p> I create a new folder in wp-content/themes, then add a style.css file with Theme Name and Template (parent theme name). Next, I enqueue parent and child styles in functions.php. After activating the child theme in WordPress admin, I can safely customize templates or CSS without losing changes during parent theme updates. </p>
</div>

<div id="verzdesign" class="mt-5"> 
 <h2> <strong> What do you know about verzdesign and why do you want to work here ? </strong></h2>
 <p> Verz Design is a top digital agency in Singapore, started in 2009. You have launched over 5,000 websites in 150+ industries and have 15K+ followers on LinkedIn. I like that you handle everything in-house—design, development, marketing, and optimization. </p> 
 <p> I enjoy creating user-friendly designs with good UX and clear business results. Your team culture of growth and collaboration matches my values. </p>
<p> I would be excited to work on brands like Panasonic, Singapore Airlines, and PSG-supported SMEs. I want to join your large team and contribute to strong design solutions from planning to post-launch strategy. </p>
</div>

<div id="leaving" class="mt-5"> 
 <h2> <strong> Can you share your reason for leaving your most recent role ? </strong></h2> 
<p> Unfortunately, my previous company was heavily dependent on a few key clients. One of the major clients discontinued their projects, which led to downsizing in the design team and my role was affected. I understand it was a business decision and not performance-related. This gave me the opportunity to look for a stable, growth-focused company like Verz Design where I can contribute long-term. </p>
</div>


<div id="recentproject" class="mt-5"> 
 <h2> <strong> Can you walk us through your most recent project and your responsibilities in it ? </strong></h2> 
<p> My recent project was Ashoka Holidays, a travel website developed in WordPress. My role was to convert designs into responsive HTML/CSS and then integrate them into WordPress using Elementor. I customized the theme, created templates for different pages, configured plugins, and ensured the site was responsive and SEO-friendly. </p>
</div>


<div id="strengths" class="mt-5"> 
<h2> <strong> What are your strengths that you believe will help you succeed in this role? </strong></h2> 
<p> One of my key strengths is my ability to develop user-friendly and visually appealing websites. I have strong skills in development using Wordpress and Shopify, and I’m also comfortable with front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. </p>
<p> Another strength is my attention to detail and cross-browser testing—I ensure that every design is consistent and responsive across devices.</p>
<p> Finally, I’m a good collaborator. In my previous projects, I worked closely with designer, marketers, and clients to deliver projects on time and aligned with business goals. I believe these strengths will help me contribute effectively at Verz Design, especially since you handle diverse projects for well-known brands and SMEs. </p>
</div>

<div id="challenge" class="mt-5"> 
<h2> <strong> What's one challenge you have faced at work, and how did you handle it ? </strong></h2> 
<p> A challenge I faced was implementing a custom design in WordPress that the theme didn’t support. I solved it by creating a child theme, customizing templates, and using Elementor to deliver the required design. </p>
</div>

<div id="prioritize" class="mt-5"> 
<h2> <strong> How do you prioritize tasks when handling multiple deadlines ? </strong></h2> 
<p> When I have multiple deadlines, I start by understanding the scope and urgency of each task. I break larger projects into smaller, manageable milestones and use a simple task list to organize my priorities. </p>
<p> I typically handle the most time-sensitive or high-impact tasks first while also setting realistic timelines for the rest. If priorities change, I communicate early with the team or client to realign. </p>
<p> This approach helps me stay organized and ensures that all deadlines are met without compromising quality. </p>
<p> I also maintain design consistency using reusable components in Figma, break down projects into phases, and stay in regular communication with teams to avoid delays. </p>
</div>


<div id="salary" class="mt-5"> 
<h2> <strong> What are your salary expectations </strong></h2> 
<p> My current salary is SGD 1000 per month. For this (remote) role, I’m targeting SGD 1,000 per month, depending on responsibilities and benefits. Working from home reduces my commuting and meal costs, so I’m flexible within this range. </p>
</div>


<div id="anyquestions" class="mt-5"> 
<h2> <strong> Do you have any question for us ? </strong></h2> 
<p> Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today. I’m really excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team. Could you please share what the next steps in the hiring process will be ? </p>
</div>



<div id="designpro" class="mt-5"> 
 <h2> <strong> 1. What is your Theme customization process? </strong></h2> 
<p>
“My WordPress theme customization process starts with analyzing the client’s requirements and design mockups. I usually create a child theme to keep the parent theme safe. Then, I convert the designs into responsive HTML/CSS/JS and integrate them into WordPress templates. I customize layouts, functions, and Elementor widgets where required. After that, I configure plugins, test across devices and browsers, optimize performance, and finally deploy the site to the live server. This process ensures a stable, responsive, and SEO-friendly website.”
</p>
</div>

<div id="negativefeedback" class="mt-5"> 
 <h2> <strong> How do you respond to negative feedback?   </strong></h2> 
<p> I see negative feedback as an opportunity to improve. I listen carefully without taking it personally and try to understand the core issue behind the feedback. If it’s unclear, I ask clarifying questions. I then reflect on how to adjust the design or process. For example, in a past project, a stakeholder felt the design lacked clarity. I reviewed the flow, simplified some elements, and after implementing changes, the feedback turned positive. My focus is always on creating a better user experience—not defending my work. </p>
</div>


<div id="improve" class="mt-5"> 
  <h2> How would you improve the UX/UI design ? </h2>
  <p> I would identify user pain points, simplify navigation, ensure accessibility and responsiveness, and use consistent visuals with clear call-to-actions to improve the user experience. I also follow a CRO (Conversion Rate Optimization) based design approach, which helps make the design more user-friendly and effective. </p>
</div>


<div id="weakness" class="mt-5"> 
  <h2> What is your biggest weakness ? </h2>
  <p> I sometimes focus too much on small details, but I’m learning to balance quality with deadlines by prioritizing tasks better. </p>
</div>


<div id="userfriendly" class="mt-5"> 
 <h2> <strong> How do you ensure your designs are user-friendly and conversion-optimized (CRO)? </strong></h2> 
  <p> "I focus on clear visual hierarchy, consistent layout, fast loading, mobile responsiveness, and strong CTAs. I use CRO techniques like A/B testing concepts, minimal form fields, and attention to whitespace to improve conversions and user experience." </p>
</div>

<div id="ui-ux" class="mt-5"> 
 <h2> <strong> difference between UI and UX design? </strong></h2> 
  <p> "UI (User Interface) focuses on the look and feel — like colors, buttons, and typography. UX (User Experience) is about the user journey and how easy or intuitive the experience is. I make sure my designs balance both: attractive visuals and smooth navigation." </p>
</div>

<div id="tools" class="mt-5"> 
 <h2> <strong> What tools do you use for web design? </strong></h2> 
  <p> "Figma is my primary tool for UI/UX design. I also have experience with Photoshop, and Adobe XD.  </p>
</div>

<div id="client" class="mt-5"> 
 <h2> <strong> How do you handle feedback from clients or developers? </strong></h2> 
  <p> I welcome feedback as part of the design improvement process. I ensure clear communication, explain design choices when needed, and am flexible to revise based on project needs — always keeping user experience and business goals in mind. </p>
</div>

<div id="deadline" class="mt-5"> 
 <h2> <strong> How do you manage tight deadlines or multiple projects? </strong></h2> 
  <p> I prioritize tasks based on urgency and complexity. I maintain design consistency using reusable components in Figma. I also break down projects into phases and stay in regular communication with teams to avoid delays. </p>
</div>

<div id="hire" class="mt-5"> 
 <h2> <strong> Why should we hire you? </strong></h2> 
“I have 5 years of experience in WordPress and frontend development, strong skills in theme customization, responsive design, and plugin integration. I deliver clean, optimized websites and I’m confident I can add value to your projects.
</div>

<div id="cro" class="mt-5"> 
 <h2> <strong> CRO (Conversion Rate Optimization) </strong></h2> 
  <p> CRO is the process of increasing the percentage of users who take a desired action on your website — like: </p>
  <ul>
    <li> Filling out a form </li>
    <li> Clicking a button </li>
    <li> Making a purchase </li>
    <li> Signing up for a newsletter </li>
  </ul>

<h2> <strong> How is it done? </strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li> Improving layout and visual hierarchy </li>
  <li> Writing strong CTAs (Call-To-Actions) </li>
  <li> Making designs cleaner and faster to load </li>
  <li> Ensuring mobile responsiveness </li>
  <li> Using A/B testing to validate changes </li>
</ul>
</div>


<div id="a/b" class="mt-5"> 
 <h2> <strong> A/B Testing (Split Testing) </strong></h2> 
  <p> A/B Testing is a method where you create two versions (Version A and Version B) of a web page (or specific section) and test which one performs better. </p>
  <h2> Examples </h2>
  <p> You're designing a landing page with a CTA button. </p>
  <ul> 
    <li> <strong> Version A: </strong> CTA button is blue and says “Buy Now” </li>
    <li> <strong> Version B: </strong> CTA button is red and says “Get Yours Today” </li>
  </ul>
  <p> You show Version A to 50% of users, and Version B to the other 50%. <br> Whichever version gets more clicks or conversions is considered the better performer. </p>

  <h2> <strong> What can you A/B test? </strong></h2>
  <ul>
    <li> Headline text </li>
    <li> Button color or text </li>
    <li> Image placements </li>
    <li> Form length </li>
    <li> Page layout </li>
    <li> Font styles and size </li>
  </ul>

  <h2> <strong> Why It Matters for a Web Designer </strong></h2>
  <p> As a designer, understanding CRO and A/B testing helps you: </p>
  <ul>
    <li> Make data-driven design decisions </li>
    <li> Design layouts that increase conversions </li>
    <li> Collaborate better with marketing and product teams </li>
  </ul>

</div>


<div id="uiuxprinciples" class="mt-5"> 
 <h2> <strong>  Key  UI/UX principles you follow when designing websites? </strong></h2> 
 <p> "I focus on simplicity, visual hierarchy, consistency, and accessibility. Clear navigation, readable typography, and proper spacing are key. I also design with the user journey in mind, ensuring every page leads to a meaningful action." </p>
</div>


<div id="aestheticdesign" class="mt-5"> 
 <h2> <strong>  How do you balance aesthetic design and website performance?  </strong></h2> 
 <p>"I optimize images using modern formats (WebP/SVG), use a minimal number of fonts and animations, and follow a clean code structure. I prioritize fast loading without compromising design by reusing components and using scalable vector assets."  </p>
</div>


<div id="accessibility" class="mt-5"> 
 <h2> <strong>  What are some common accessibility standards (WCAG) you follow in your designs?  </strong></h2> 
 <p> "I ensure sufficient color contrast (WCAG AA), use semantic HTML for screen readers, provide alt text for images, and maintain proper heading hierarchy. I also design for keyboard navigation and avoid elements that could trigger motion sensitivity."  </p>
</div>

<div id="multi-lingual" class="mt-5">
  <h2> <strong> Do you have experience designing for multi-lingual websites (English/Chinese/Tamil)? </strong></h2>
  <p> "Yes, I have designed for multi-lingual websites where I used language switchers, flexible layouts for varying text lengths, and Unicode-compatible fonts. I ensure that the design supports right-to-left or vertical scripts when needed and test for readability across all languages." </p>
</div>

<div id="dataprivacy" class="mt-5">
  <h2> <strong> Are you familiar with PDPA (Singapore’s data privacy regulations) and how it affects design (e.g., cookie consent)? </strong></h2>
  <p> "Yes, PDPA requires user consent for data collection. I design clear cookie consent banners and easy-to-understand privacy options. I ensure users can access, update, or remove their personal data easily from the interface, complying with PDPA requirements."  </p>
</div>


<div id="localdesign" class="mt-5">
  <h2> <strong> How do you stay updated on local design trends and user preferences in Singapore? </strong></h2>
  <p> "I follow Singapore-based design communities on LinkedIn and Meetup, attend UXSG and other local conferences, and research popular local websites. I also gather feedback from real users in Singapore to understand cultural preferences and usability needs." </p>
</div>



<div id="figma" class="mt-5"> 
<h2> <strong> Figma </strong></h2>

<p class="mt-4 p-0 m-0"> <strong> What is Figma and how does it differ from other design tools? </strong></p>
<p> Figma is a cloud-based design tool used for interface design, prototyping, and collaboration. Unlike tools like Adobe XD or Sketch, Figma allows real-time collaboration directly within the browser without the need for external software installation. </p>

<p class="mt-4 p-0 m-0"> <strong> Figma designs into Angular components? </strong></p>
<p> I analyze the layout, spacing, colors, and typography in Figma, then structure the HTML and SCSS accordingly. I use flexbox/grid for layout, and variables for consistent styling. I ensure responsiveness using media queries or utility classes. </p>

<p class="mt-4 p-0 m-0" id="share"> <strong> How do you share a Figma file for collaboration? </strong></p>
<p> I can share a Figma file by clicking the “Share” button at the top-right of the interface and adjusting the sharing settings to allow view-only or edit permissions for collaborators. </p>

<p class="mt-4 p-0 m-0" id="reusablecompanent"> <strong> How do you create a reusable component in Figma? </strong></p>
<p> To create a reusable component, select an object or group of objects, right-click, and choose “Create Component” or press Ctrl + Alt + K. <br> This allows the component to be reused across multiple frames or designs. </p>


<p class="mt-4 p-0 m-0" id="figmaframe"> <strong> Figma frames and used </strong></p>
<p> Frames in Figma are like artboards in other design tools. They define the boundaries of a design and are used to contain UI elements, creating layouts for different devices or pages. </p>

<p class="mt-4 p-0 m-0" id="figmaprototype"> <strong> Prototype </strong></p>
<p> Creating prototypes in Figma allows you to simulate the flow and interactions of a real application — without writing code. It's useful for UI/UX design validation, client demos, and developer handoff. </p>
<ul>
  <li> Use the Frame Tool (F) to create screens (e.g., Login, Dashboard, Profile). </li>
  <li> Add buttons, inputs, navigation elements using the toolbar. </li>
  <li> Click the “Prototype” tab in the right sidebar (next to “Design”). </li>
  <li> You will now be able to connect elements visually. </li>
  <li> Select a button or element (e.g., “Login” button). </li>
  <li> Click and drag the blue node (circle) to the target frame (e.g., Dashboard screen). </li>
  <li> Set the Starting Frame </li>
  <li> Click the “Present” button (top-right corner). </li>
  <li> This opens a preview window where you can click and interact with the prototype as if it's a real app. </li>
  <li> Share the Prototype, Click “Share” → Set permissions (Anyone with the link can view)</li>
</ul>

<p class="mt-4 p-0 m-0"> <strong> prototype interactions in Figma? </strong></p>
<p> In the Prototype tab, select a frame or element, click the blue node, and drag it to the target frame. You can then define the interaction (e.g., “On Click”) and the animation (e.g., “Smart Animate”). </p>

<h2 id="component"> <strong> component </strong></h2>
<p> A Component is a reusable UI element (like a button, card, input, header, etc.) that you can use across your design. When you update the main component, all its instances update automatically. </p>
<p> <strong> Use Cases </strong> - Buttons, Navbars, Cards/Products, Forms/Input Fields, Headers/Footers</p>



<p class="mt-4 p-0 m-0" id="auto"> <strong> What is “Auto Layout” in Figma </strong></p>
<p> Auto Layout allows dynamic adjustment of component size and positioning based on its content. It is useful for responsive design and creating flexible UI components like buttons, cards, and lists. </p>


<p class="mt-4 p-0 m-0" id="fonts"> <strong> Import external fonts into Figma? </strong></p>
<p> Figma automatically accesses Google Fonts, but to use custom fonts, you need to install the Figma desktop app. Once installed, the app will sync with local fonts on your system. </p>


<p class="mt-4 p-0 m-0" id="assets"> <strong>  Export assets from Figma? </strong> </p>
<p> Select the object or frame you want to export, click on the “Export” section in the right sidebar, choose the format (e.g., PNG, SVG, PDF), and click the “Export” button. </p>


<p class="mt-4 p-0 m-0"> <strong>  How can you apply constraints to elements in Figma? </strong> </p>
<p> Constraints define how elements should behave when a frame is resized. Select an object and set constraints (e.g., left, right, top, bottom) in the right-hand panel to ensure responsive layouts. </p>

<p class="mt-4 p-0 m-0" id="frame"> <strong> Figma frames and groups? </strong></p>
<p> Groups are used to organize elements without changing their individual behaviors, while frames act as containers that define size, and layout, and are often used for screens, components, or responsive layouts. </p>

<p class="mt-4 p-0 m-0" id="vector"> <strong> use vector networks in Figma? </strong></p>
<p> Unlike traditional vector paths, vector networks allow paths to branch out in multiple directions from a single node. This makes drawing complex shapes easier, as nodes can have multiple connected segments. </p>

<p class="mt-4 p-0 m-0" id="pen"> <strong> How do you use the “Pen Tool” in Figma? </strong> </p>
<p> The Pen Tool (P) is used to create vector shapes by plotting points on the canvas. Click to create straight lines, or click and drag to create curves. You can adjust curves using handles after placing points. </p>

<p class="mt-4 p-0 m-0" id="shadow"> <strong> shadows and effects </strong></p>
<p> Select an object, go to the “Effects” section in the right-hand sidebar, and click the “+” to add shadows, blurs, or inner glows. You can adjust parameters such as blur, spread, and opacity. </p>

<p class="mt-4 p-0 m-0" id="team"> <strong> Team Library </strong> </p>
<p> The Team Library allows designers to create, share, and reuse components, styles, and assets across multiple projects, ensuring consistency and speeding up collaboration within a team. </p>

<p class="mt-4 p-0 m-0" id="color"> <strong>  create and apply color styles in Figma? </strong></p>
<p> Select an element, go to the “Fill” section, and choose a color. Click the four dots next to the color and save it as a style. You can then reuse this color style across multiple elements and components. </p>


<p class="mt-4 p-0 m-0"> <strong>  collaborate in real-time in Figma? </strong></p>
<p> Multiple users can collaborate on the same file simultaneously in Figma. Each user’s cursor is displayed in real-time, and any changes made by one user are immediately visible to others. </p>

<p class="mt-4 p-0 m-0"><strong> Handle version control in Figma? </strong></p>
<p> Figma automatically saves every change. You can also manually create versions by selecting “File” > “Show Version History,” allowing you to restore or view previous states of the design. </p>

<p class="mt-4 p-0 m-0" id="animate"><strong> Smart Animate </strong></p>
<p> “Smart Animate” in Figma automates the transition of properties (like position, opacity, and size) between two frames during a prototype. It is used to create smooth animations between interactive states. </p>

<p class="mt-4 p-0 m-0" id="responsive"><strong> Responsive designs in Figma? </strong></p> 
<p> You can use Auto Layout, Constraints, and Frames to create designs that automatically adjust based on screen size, ensuring that your layouts adapt to different device dimensions. </p>

<p class="mt-4 p-0 m-0" id="grid"><strong> Grid systems in Figma ? </strong></p>
<p> Grid systems help in aligning elements consistently. You can add grids by selecting a frame and clicking on the “Layout Grid” in the right sidebar, where you can define the type (e.g., columns, rows, grid) and spacing. </p>

<p class="mt-4 p-0 m-0"> <strong> Handle inconsistencies between design and implementation? </strong> </p>
<p> I communicate with the design team to clarify expectations and ensure that user experience and consistency are maintained. Sometimes, small adjustments are made based on feasibility or responsiveness. </p>

<p class="mt-4 p-0 m-0"> <strong> Have you worked with design tokens or Figma variables? </strong> </p>
<p> Yes, They help maintain consistency in color, typography, spacing, and can be mapped into Angular styles or CSS variables. </p>

<p class="mt-4 p-0 m-0" id="figmaVariable"> <strong> Figma Variables </strong> </p>
<p> Figma Variables are reusable design tokens that help you keep your designs consistent and make updates easier. Instead of hardcoding colors, spacing, or other values in each design element, you can define them once as variables and reuse them everywhere. </p>

<p class="mt-4 p-0 m-0" id="figmaphotoshop"> <strong> Figma and Photoshop </strong> </p>
<p> Figma and Photoshop are both powerful design tools, but they are built for different purposes and workflows.  </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong> Figma </strong></li>
  <li> Primarily for UI/UX design, web/app design, prototyping, and collaboration. </li>
  <li> Vector-based (scales easily without losing quality). </li>
  <li> Web-based (runs in browser, Windows, Mac, Linux) </li>
  <li> Cloud storage by default (easy sharing) </li>
  <li> Real-time collaboration like Google Docs </li>
  <li> Multiple designers can work simultaneously on the same file. </li>
  <li> Has a free plan and paid plans for teams. </li>
  <li> UI kits, components, variables, auto layout, prototyping </li>
   <li><strong> Photoshop </strong></li>
   <li> Primarily for photo editing, raster-based design, and advanced image manipulation. </li>
   <li>  Raster-based (pixel-based, ideal for images and detailed editing). </li>
   <li> Desktop software (Windows & Mac) </li>
   <li> Files saved locally or via Adobe Cloud </li>
   <li> Collaboration is not as seamless </li>
   <li> Single-user editing; collaboration requires sending files back and forth. </li>
   <li> Paid subscription (Adobe Creative Cloud). </li>
   <li> Advanced photo manipulation, filters, 3D tools, brushes</li>
</ul>

<p class="mt-4 p-0 m-0" id="darklight"> <strong> How do you handle light and dark mode designs in Figma? </strong> </p>
<p> Use Variable Collections (e.g., Light & Dark). Each variable (e.g., primary color) has different values per mode. Switching the mode updates the entire design automatically. </p>

<p class="mt-4 p-0 m-0" id="collaboration"> <strong> How does Figma handle real-time collaboration? </strong> </p>
<p> Figma works in the cloud, allowing multiple users to edit the same file simultaneously (like Google Docs). Changes sync instantly, and you can comment directly on designs. </p>

<p class="mt-4 p-0 m-0" id="plugin-widgets"> <strong> What are Figma Plugins and Widgets? Can you name a few you use? </strong> </p>
<ul>
  <li> Plugins: Small tools that extend Figma’s functionality (e.g., stock image insertion, icon sets, accessibility checks). </li>
  <li> Widgets: Interactive elements that you can place on the Figma canvas (mainly used in FigJam for collaboration). </li>
  <li> Plugins: Icons8 / Material Icons – for adding icons quickly. </li>
  <li> Content Reel – for dummy text, names, and images. </li>
  <li> Contrast – for checking color accessibility. </li>
  <li> Autoflow – for drawing user flows. </li>
  <li> widgets : Voting Widget (FigJam) – for quick team feedback. </li>
  <li> Timer Widget – for collaborative sessions. </li>
</ul>
