<div id="intro" class="mt-5">
<h2> <strong> Intro </strong> </h2>
<p> My name is Santosh Kumar, and I have over 8 years of experience as a web designer.  I started my career at Redcube Digital Pvt. Ltd. as a Web Designer. which I now use for most of my design work. I specialize in creating clean, user-friendly, and CRO-based (Conversion Rate Optimization) designs that are both visually appealing and performance-driven. </p>

<p> I always start by understanding the client’s requirements, create the design accordingly, and once it's approved, I also handle the front-end coding part. I have hands-on coding knowledge and convert the approved designs into responsive HTML using CSS. </p>

<p> Over the years, I've worked on a wide variety of projects, including landing pages, eCommerce sites, dashboards, and responsive websites. I enjoy collaborating with developers, product teams, and marketers to make sure the final product meets both business and user goals." </p>

===========================

<p> In development, I have worked on several projects using WordPress and Shopify. Based on the design requirements, I handled UI implementation and ensured pixel-perfect results in both platforms. I managed the entire workflow — starting from creating the design, converting it into HTML/CSS using Bootstrap, making it fully responsive, and finally integrating it into WordPress or Shopify themes." </p>

<h2> <strong> Why you left the previouse company. </strong></h2>
<p> My previous job was a 3-year contractual position. Once the contract period ended, my tenure with the company concluded, which is why I left the role. </p>
<p class="p-0 m-0"> <strong> Reason stay with 6 month </strong></p>
<p> I also used this time to explore remote work opportunities and align with a role that truly fits my long-term goals. </p>

<hr>

<h2> <strong> Why you want to join less salary ? </strong></h2>
<p> In my previous company, my salary was higher, but my daily expenses such as travel and food were also significantly more. By working from home, I can save on those daily costs, which is why I am comfortable accepting a salary that is slightly lower than my previous one.</p>

<div id="designpro" class="mt-5"> 
 <h2> <strong> 1. What is your design process? </strong></h2> 
  <p> "I start by understanding the client's requirements and goals. Then I create wireframes or design mockups in Figma. Once approved, I convert the design into responsive HTML using CSS and Bootstrap. If required, I implement the design into CMS platforms like WordPress or Shopify, ensuring it's visually accurate and performance-optimized." </p>
</div>

<div id="userfriendly" class="mt-5"> 
 <h2> <strong> How do you ensure your designs are user-friendly and conversion-optimized (CRO)? </strong></h2> 
  <p> "I focus on clear visual hierarchy, consistent layout, fast loading, mobile responsiveness, and strong CTAs. I use CRO techniques like A/B testing concepts, minimal form fields, and attention to whitespace to improve conversions and user experience." </p>
</div>

<div id="ui-ux" class="mt-5"> 
 <h2> <strong> difference between UI and UX design? </strong></h2> 
  <p> "UI (User Interface) focuses on the look and feel — like colors, buttons, and typography. UX (User Experience) is about the user journey and how easy or intuitive the experience is. I make sure my designs balance both: attractive visuals and smooth navigation." </p>
</div>

<div id="tools" class="mt-5"> 
 <h2> <strong> What tools do you use for web design? </strong></h2> 
  <p> "Figma is my primary tool for UI/UX design. I also have experience with Photoshop, and Adobe XD.  </p>
</div>

<div id="client" class="mt-5"> 
 <h2> <strong> How do you handle feedback from clients or developers? </strong></h2> 
  <p> I welcome feedback as part of the design improvement process. I ensure clear communication, explain design choices when needed, and am flexible to revise based on project needs — always keeping user experience and business goals in mind. </p>
</div>

<div id="deadline" class="mt-5"> 
 <h2> <strong> How do you manage tight deadlines or multiple projects? </strong></h2> 
  <p> I prioritize tasks based on urgency and complexity. I maintain design consistency using reusable components in Figma. I also break down projects into phases and stay in regular communication with teams to avoid delays. </p>
</div>

<div id="hire" class="mt-5"> 
 <h2> <strong> Why should we hire you? </strong></h2> 
  <p> "With my solid design foundation, up-to-date toolset (like Figma), coding skills, and understanding of CRO, I can deliver high-quality designs that not only look great but also perform. I also bring a strong ability to collaborate and adapt in fast-paced environments."  </p>
</div>


<div id="cro" class="mt-5"> 
 <h2> <strong> CRO (Conversion Rate Optimization) </strong></h2> 
  <p> CRO is the process of increasing the percentage of users who take a desired action on your website — like: </p>
  <ul>
    <li> Filling out a form </li>
    <li> Clicking a button </li>
    <li> Making a purchase </li>
    <li> Signing up for a newsletter </li>
  </ul>

<h2> <strong> How is it done? </strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li> Improving layout and visual hierarchy </li>
  <li> Writing strong CTAs (Call-To-Actions) </li>
  <li> Making designs cleaner and faster to load </li>
  <li> Ensuring mobile responsiveness </li>
  <li> Using A/B testing to validate changes </li>
</ul>
</div>


<div id="a/b" class="mt-5"> 
 <h2> <strong> A/B Testing (Split Testing) </strong></h2> 
  <p> A/B Testing is a method where you create two versions (Version A and Version B) of a web page (or specific section) and test which one performs better. </p>
  <h2> Examples </h2>
  <p> You're designing a landing page with a CTA button. </p>
  <ul> 
    <li> <strong> Version A: </strong> CTA button is blue and says “Buy Now” </li>
    <li> <strong> Version B: </strong> CTA button is red and says “Get Yours Today” </li>
  </ul>
  <p> You show Version A to 50% of users, and Version B to the other 50%. <br> Whichever version gets more clicks or conversions is considered the better performer. </p>

  <h2> <strong> What can you A/B test? </strong></h2>
  <ul>
    <li> Headline text </li>
    <li> Button color or text </li>
    <li> Image placements </li>
    <li> Form length </li>
    <li> Page layout </li>
    <li> Font styles and size </li>
  </ul>

  <h2> <strong> Why It Matters for a Web Designer </strong></h2>
  <p> As a designer, understanding CRO and A/B testing helps you: </p>
  <ul>
    <li> Make data-driven design decisions </li>
    <li> Design layouts that increase conversions </li>
    <li> Collaborate better with marketing and product teams </li>
  </ul>

</div>




<div id="figma" class="mt-5"> 
<h2> <strong> Figma </strong></h2>

<p class="mt-4 p-0 m-0"> <strong> What is Figma and how does it differ from other design tools? </strong></p>
<p> Figma is a cloud-based design tool used for interface design, prototyping, and collaboration. Unlike tools like Adobe XD or Sketch, Figma allows real-time collaboration directly within the browser without the need for external software installation. </p>

<p class="mt-4 p-0 m-0"> <strong> Figma designs into Angular components? </strong></p>
<p> I analyze the layout, spacing, colors, and typography in Figma, then structure the HTML and SCSS accordingly. I use flexbox/grid for layout, and variables for consistent styling. I ensure responsiveness using media queries or utility classes. </p>

<p class="mt-4 p-0 m-0"> <strong> How do you share a Figma file for collaboration? </strong></p>
<p> I can share a Figma file by clicking the “Share” button at the top-right of the interface and adjusting the sharing settings to allow view-only or edit permissions for collaborators. </p>

<p class="mt-4 p-0 m-0"> <strong> How do you create a reusable component in Figma? </strong></p>
<p> To create a reusable component, select an object or group of objects, right-click, and choose “Create Component” or press Ctrl + Alt + K. <br> This allows the component to be reused across multiple frames or designs. </p>


<p class="mt-4 p-0 m-0"> <strong> Figma frames and used </strong></p>
<p> Frames in Figma are like artboards in other design tools. They define the boundaries of a design and are used to contain UI elements, creating layouts for different devices or pages. </p>

<p class="mt-4 p-0 m-0" id="figmaprototype"> <strong> Prototype </strong></p>
<p> Creating prototypes in Figma allows you to simulate the flow and interactions of a real application — without writing code. It's useful for UI/UX design validation, client demos, and developer handoff. </p>
<ul>
  <li> Use the Frame Tool (F) to create screens (e.g., Login, Dashboard, Profile). </li>
  <li> Add buttons, inputs, navigation elements using the toolbar. </li>
  <li> Click the “Prototype” tab in the right sidebar (next to “Design”). </li>
  <li> You will now be able to connect elements visually. </li>
  <li> Select a button or element (e.g., “Login” button). </li>
  <li> Click and drag the blue node (circle) to the target frame (e.g., Dashboard screen). </li>
  <li> Set the Starting Frame </li>
  <li> Click the “Present” button (top-right corner). </li>
  <li> This opens a preview window where you can click and interact with the prototype as if it's a real app. </li>
  <li> Share the Prototype, Click “Share” → Set permissions (Anyone with the link can view)</li>
</ul>

<p class="mt-4 p-0 m-0"> <strong> prototype interactions in Figma? </strong></p>
<p> In the Prototype tab, select a frame or element, click the blue node, and drag it to the target frame. You can then define the interaction (e.g., “On Click”) and the animation (e.g., “Smart Animate”). </p>

<h2 id="component"> <strong> component </strong></h2>
<p> A Component is a reusable UI element (like a button, card, input, header, etc.) that you can use across your design. When you update the main component, all its instances update automatically. </p>
<p> <strong> Use Cases </strong> - Buttons, Navbars, Cards/Products, Forms/Input Fields, Headers/Footers</p>



<p class="mt-4 p-0 m-0" id="auto"> <strong> What is “Auto Layout” in Figma </strong></p>
<p> Auto Layout allows dynamic adjustment of component size and positioning based on its content. It is useful for responsive design and creating flexible UI components like buttons, cards, and lists. </p>


<p class="mt-4 p-0 m-0" id="fonts"> <strong> Import external fonts into Figma? </strong></p>
<p> Figma automatically accesses Google Fonts, but to use custom fonts, you need to install the Figma desktop app. Once installed, the app will sync with local fonts on your system. </p>


<p class="mt-4 p-0 m-0" id="assets"> <strong>  Export assets from Figma? </strong> </p>
<p> Select the object or frame you want to export, click on the “Export” section in the right sidebar, choose the format (e.g., PNG, SVG, PDF), and click the “Export” button. </p>


<p class="mt-4 p-0 m-0"> <strong>  How can you apply constraints to elements in Figma? </strong> </p>
<p> Constraints define how elements should behave when a frame is resized. Select an object and set constraints (e.g., left, right, top, bottom) in the right-hand panel to ensure responsive layouts. </p>

<p class="mt-4 p-0 m-0" id="frame"> <strong> Figma frames and groups? </strong></p>
<p> Groups are used to organize elements without changing their individual behaviors, while frames act as containers that define size, and layout, and are often used for screens, components, or responsive layouts. </p>

<p class="mt-4 p-0 m-0" id="vector"> <strong> use vector networks in Figma? </strong></p>
<p> Unlike traditional vector paths, vector networks allow paths to branch out in multiple directions from a single node. This makes drawing complex shapes easier, as nodes can have multiple connected segments. </p>

<p class="mt-4 p-0 m-0" id="pen"> <strong> How do you use the “Pen Tool” in Figma? </strong> </p>
<p> The Pen Tool (P) is used to create vector shapes by plotting points on the canvas. Click to create straight lines, or click and drag to create curves. You can adjust curves using handles after placing points. </p>

<p class="mt-4 p-0 m-0" id="shadow"> <strong> shadows and effects </strong></p>
<p> Select an object, go to the “Effects” section in the right-hand sidebar, and click the “+” to add shadows, blurs, or inner glows. You can adjust parameters such as blur, spread, and opacity. </p>

<p class="mt-4 p-0 m-0" id="team"> <strong> Team Library </strong> </p>
<p> The Team Library allows designers to create, share, and reuse components, styles, and assets across multiple projects, ensuring consistency and speeding up collaboration within a team. </p>

<p class="mt-4 p-0 m-0" id="color"> <strong>  create and apply color styles in Figma? </strong></p>
<p> Select an element, go to the “Fill” section, and choose a color. Click the four dots next to the color and save it as a style. You can then reuse this color style across multiple elements and components. </p>


<p class="mt-4 p-0 m-0"> <strong>  collaborate in real-time in Figma? </strong></p>
<p> Multiple users can collaborate on the same file simultaneously in Figma. Each user’s cursor is displayed in real-time, and any changes made by one user are immediately visible to others. </p>

<p class="mt-4 p-0 m-0"><strong> Handle version control in Figma? </strong></p>
<p> Figma automatically saves every change. You can also manually create versions by selecting “File” > “Show Version History,” allowing you to restore or view previous states of the design. </p>

<p class="mt-4 p-0 m-0" id="animate"><strong> Smart Animate </strong></p>
<p> “Smart Animate” in Figma automates the transition of properties (like position, opacity, and size) between two frames during a prototype. It is used to create smooth animations between interactive states. </p>

<p class="mt-4 p-0 m-0" id="responsive"><strong> Responsive designs in Figma? </strong></p> 
<p> You can use Auto Layout, Constraints, and Frames to create designs that automatically adjust based on screen size, ensuring that your layouts adapt to different device dimensions. </p>

<p class="mt-4 p-0 m-0" id="grid"><strong> Grid systems in Figma ? </strong></p>
<p> Grid systems help in aligning elements consistently. You can add grids by selecting a frame and clicking on the “Layout Grid” in the right sidebar, where you can define the type (e.g., columns, rows, grid) and spacing. </p>

<p class="mt-4 p-0 m-0"> <strong> Handle inconsistencies between design and implementation? </strong> </p>
<p> I communicate with the design team to clarify expectations and ensure that user experience and consistency are maintained. Sometimes, small adjustments are made based on feasibility or responsiveness. </p>

<p class="mt-4 p-0 m-0"> <strong> Have you worked with design tokens or Figma variables? </strong> </p>
<p> Yes, They help maintain consistency in color, typography, spacing, and can be mapped into Angular styles or CSS variables. </p>
